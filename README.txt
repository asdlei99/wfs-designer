# WFS Designer #

The current version of WFSDesigner has been developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional.

WFS Designer requires Qt 4.7.1, libsndfile, fftw, and portaudio.
Project files are included for VS 2008. These project files are setup with the dependencies in the following file structure:

/fftw/
/portaudio/
/libsndfile/
/WFSDesigner/[project files]

C:/Qt/4.7.1/

So the dependencies are set up side by side with the main WFSDesigner project folder, and Qt is installed at C:/Qt/4.7.1. Of course, you can set up your own project files with the dependencies located wherever you see fit.
